# `defmt`

`defmt` ("de format", short for "deferred formatting") is a highly efficient logging framework that targets resource-constrained devices, like microcontrollers.

For more details about the framework check the book at <https://defmt.ferrous-systems.com>.

## Setup

### New project

The fastest way to get started with `defmt` is to use our [app-template] to set up a new Cortex-M embedded project.

[app-template]: https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template

### Existing project

To include `defmt` in your existing project, follow our [Application Setup guide].

## MSRV

The minimum supported Rust version is 1.76 (or Ferrocene 24.05). `defmt` is tested against the latest stable Rust version and the MSRV.

## Support

`defmt` is part of the [Knurling] project, [Ferrous Systems]' effort at
improving tooling used to develop for embedded systems.
