# `defmt-macros`

`defmt` ("de format", short for "deferred formatting") is a highly efficient logging framework that targets resource-constrained devices, like microcontrollers.

For more details about the framework check the book at <https://defmt.ferrous-systems.com>.

This library contains the proc macros used by
[`defmt`](https://crates.io/crates/defmt).

## MSRV

The minimum supported Rust version is 1.76 (or Ferrocene 24.05). `defmt` is tested against the latest stable Rust version and the MSRV.

## Support

`defmt` is part of the [Knurling] project, [Ferrous Systems]' effort at
improving tooling used to develop for embedded systems.
