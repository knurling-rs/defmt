# `defmt-print`

> A tool to decode and print [`defmt`] data

[`defmt`]: https://crates.io/crates/defmt

There's no stable library API to decode `defmt` log frames but this tool can be used to decode defmt
data and print it to the console.

## Support

`defmt-print` is part of the [Knurling] project, [Ferrous Systems]' effort at
improving tooling used to develop for embedded systems.
