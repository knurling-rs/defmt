# `defmt-test`

`defmt-test` is a test harness for embedded devices that lets you write and run unit tests *on your device* as if you were using the built-in `#[test]` attribute.

It is compatible with [rust-analyzer]'s `▶ Run Test` button, which means you can flash and run your tests straight from VS Code:

![demo: clicking the run button above a defmt_test::tests module leads to flashing & test run ](./demo.gif)

For a full list of defmt-test's capabilities, please refer to the documentation below.

## Using `defmt-test` in a new project

We suggest you start from the [`app-template`].
From there you can execute `cargo test --lib` to run library unit tests, i.e. `#[test]` functions in the library crate (`src/lib.rs`).

[`app-template`]: https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template

``` console
$ cargo test --lib
(..)
(1/1) running `it_works`...
└─ app::unit_tests::__defmt_test_entry @ src/lib.rs:33
all tests passed!
└─ app::unit_tests::__defmt_test_entry @ src/lib.rs:28
(..)
(HOST) INFO  device halted without error
```

And execute `cargo test --test integration` to run integration tests, i.e. the `tests/integration.rs` file.

``` console
$ cargo test --test integration
(..)
0.000000 INFO  (1/2) running `assert_true`...
└─ test::tests::__defmt_test_entry @ tests/test.rs:7
0.000001 INFO  (2/2) running `assert_false`...
└─ test::tests::__defmt_test_entry @ tests/test.rs:7
0.000002 ERROR panicked at 'TODO: write actual tests', testsuite/tests/test.rs:16:9

```

NOTE all `#[test]` functions within a file are guaranteed to run sequentially

## Adding `defmt-test` to an existing project

If you want to add `defmt-test` to an existing Cargo project / package, for each *crate* that you want to test you need to do these changes in `Cargo.toml`:

- add `defmt-test` as a `dev-dependency`
- for each crate that you want to test, set `harness` to `false` to disable the default test harness, the `test` crate which depends on `std`. examples below

``` toml
# Cargo.toml

# for the library crate (src/lib.rs)
[lib]
harness = false

# for each crate in the `tests` directory
[[test]]
name = "test-name" # tests/test-name.rs
harness = false

[[test]]
name = "second" # tests/second.rs
harness = false
```

The other thing to be aware is that `cargo test` will compile *all* crates in the package, or workspace.
This may include crates that you don't want to test, like `src/main.rs` or each crate in `src/bin` or `examples`.
To identify which crates are being compiled by `cargo test`, run `cargo test -j1 -v` and look for the `--crate-name` flag passed to each `rustc` invocation.

To test only a subset of the crates in the package / workspace you have two options:

- you can specify each crate when you invoke `cargo test`. for example, `cargo test --lib --test integration` tests two crates: the library crate (`src/lib.rs`) and `tests/integration.rs`
- you can disable tests for the crates that you don't want to test -- example below -- and then you can use `cargo test` to test all crates that were not disabled.

if you have this project structure

``` console
$ tree .
.
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│  ├── lib.rs
│  └── main.rs
└── tests
   └── integration.rs
```

and have `src/lib.rs` set up for tests but don't want to test `src/main.rs` you'll need to disable tests for `src/main.rs`

``` toml
# Cargo.toml
[package]
# ..
name = "app"

[[bin]] # <- add this section
name = "app" # src/main.rs
test = false
```

## Adding state

An `#[init]` function can be written within the `#[tests]` module.
This function will be executed before all unit tests and its return value, the test suite *state*, can be passed to unit tests as an argument.

``` rust
// state shared across unit tests
struct MyState {
    flag: bool,
}

#[defmt_test::tests]
mod tests {
    #[init]
    fn init() -> super::MyState {
        // state initial value
        super::MyState {
            flag: true,
        }
    }

    // This function is called before each test case.
    // It accesses the state created in `init`,
    // though like with `test`, state access is optional.
    #[before_each]
    fn before_each(state: &mut super::MyState) {
        defmt::println!("State flag before is {}", state.flag);
    }

    // This function is called after each test
    #[after_each]
    fn after_each(state: &mut super::MyState) {
        defmt::println!("State flag after is {}", state.flag);
    }

    // this unit test doesn't access the state
    #[test]
    fn assert_true() {
        assert!(true);
    }

    // but this test does
    #[test]
    fn assert_flag(state: &mut super::MyState) {
        assert!(state.flag)
        state.flag = false;
    }
}
```

``` console
$ cargo test -p testsuite
0.000000 (1/2) running `assert_true`...
└─ integration::tests::__defmt_test_entry @ tests/integration.rs:37
0.000001 State flag before is true
└─ integration::tests::before_each @ tests/integration.rs:26
0.000002 State flag after is true
└─ integration::tests::after_each @ tests/integration.rs:32
0.000003 (2/2) running `assert_flag`...
└─ integration::tests::__defmt_test_entry @ tests/integration.rs:43
0.000004 State flag before is true
└─ integration::tests::before_each @ tests/integration.rs:26
0.000005 State flag after is false
└─ integration::tests::after_each @ tests/integration.rs:32
0.000006 all tests passed!
└─ integration::tests::__defmt_test_entry @ tests/integration.rs:11
```

## Teardown

A `#[teardown]` function can be written within the `#[tests]` module.
This function will be executed after all unit tests passed.
The test suite *state* may be passed to the teardown function as an argument.

``` rust
// state shared across unit tests
struct MyState {
    flag: bool,
}

#[defmt_test::tests]
mod tests {
    #[init]
    fn init() -> super::MyState {
        // state initial value
        super::MyState {
            flag: true,
        }
    }

    // This function is called after all test cases passed.
    // It accesses the state created in `init`,
    // though like with `test`, state access is optional.
    #[teardown]
    fn teardown(state: &mut super::MyState) {
        defmt::println!("State flag in teardown is {}", state.flag);
    }

    // this test accesses the state created in `init`
    #[test]
    fn assert_flag(state: &mut super::MyState) {
        assert!(state.flag)
        state.flag = false;
    }
}
```

## Test Outcome

Test functions may either return `()` and panic on failure, or return any other type that implements the `TestOutcome` trait, such as `Result`.

This allows tests to indicate failure via `Result`, which allows using the `?` operator to propagate errors.

Similar to Rust's built-in `#[should_panic]` attribute, `defmt-test` supports a `#[should_error]` attribute, which inverts the meaning of the returned `TestOutcome`.
`Err` makes the test pass, while `Ok`/`()` make it fail.
