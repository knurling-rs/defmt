> Transmit [`defmt`] log messages over the Cortex-M Debugger Semihosting protocol.

`defmt` ("de format", short for "deferred formatting") is a highly efficient logging framework that targets resource-constrained devices, like microcontrollers.

For more details about the framework check the book at https://defmt.ferrous-systems.com

Note that Semihosting operations are very slow. This is really only useful if
you are running in QEMU can hence can't use RTT. See
<https://github.com/ferrous-systems/rust-training/tree/9d5f48c9a62ccadb11d942847de47146b15638d0/example-code/qemu-thumbv7em>
for an example of using this crate with QEMU.
