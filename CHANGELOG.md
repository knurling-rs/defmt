## [v0.1.3] - 2020-11-30

### Fixed

- [#290] fixed cross compilation to ARMv6-M and other targets that have no CAS (Compare-and-Swap)
  primitives when the "alloc" feature is enabled

[#290]: https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt/pull/290

## [v0.1.2] - 2020-11-26

### Added

- [#263] [#276] add and document `write!` macro
- [#273] [#280] add and document `unwrap!` macro

- [#267], [#281] add `Debug2Format` and `Display2Format` adapters
- [#279] started adding notes about feature availability (e.g. "defmt 0.1.2 and up")
