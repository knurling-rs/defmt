/// Encode raw defmt frames for sending over the wire.
///
/// defmt emits "log frames", which are sequences of bytes. The raw log frame data
/// is then *encoded* prior to sending over the wire.
///
/// `Encoder` will encode the frames according to the currently selected
/// `encoding-*` Cargo feature. See `Cargo.toml` for the supported encodings
/// and their tradeoffs.
///
/// Encodings may perform two functions:
///
/// - Framing: Adds extra data to allow the encoder to know when each frame starts
/// and ends in the stream. Unframed log frames already contain enough information for
/// the decoder to know when they end, so framing is optional. However, without framing
/// the decoder must receive all bytes intact or it may "lose sync". With framing, it can
/// recover from missing/corrupted data, and can start decoding from the "middle" of an
/// already-running stream.
/// - Compression: The frame data has rather low entropy (for example, it contains many
/// zero bytes due to encoding all integers in fixed with, and will likely contain many
/// repetitions). Compression can decrease the on-the-wire required bandwidth.
///
/// defmt provides the `Encoder` separately instead of feeding already-encoded bytes
/// to the `Logger` because `Logger` implementations may decide to allow
/// concurrent logging from multiple "contexts" such as threads or interrupt
/// priority levels. In this case, the Logger implementation needs to create one
/// Encoder for each such context.
